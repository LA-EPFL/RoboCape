Robots Arena : Network Based System of Motion Control of Robotic Vehicle
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This repository is a submodule of the **Robots Arena** project. It is dedicated
to the Beaglebone cape extension that serves as hardware platform. The idea of
this hardware platform is to allow the user to transform any mechanically
actuated platform, for example a RC car or a quadcopter base, into a robotic
vehicle that can be controlled by a remote server.

The repository contains all the design files of the Beaglebone cape extension.
* The **schematic**
* The **PCB**
* **Production files**

Note: this project has been developped using the KiCad EDA suite which is an
open source project.

Schematic
---------
The schematic is divided into two parts that can be found in the `.sch` files.

PCB
---
The PCB is a two-layer board that can be found in the `.kicad_pcb` file.

Production files
----------------
Production files are provided in Gerber format in the
(gerber)[https://github.com/SyrianSpock/robot-arena-cape/tree/gerber] section
if you want to make the cape extension by yourself.

TODO
----
* Add a bill of materials
* Detail choice of components and circuitry in wiki

References
----------
* Dedicated Wiki section
* KiCad EDA suite
* Beaglebone Black
